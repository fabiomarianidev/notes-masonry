# React notes app, with a masonry layout
This is a small project to create a "masonry" (aka Pinterest) layout (also similar to Google Keep layout).  
It attempts to keep a similar number of notes for each column, regardless of the size of each note.  
It is responsive, adapting the number of columns to the screen size.
It uses Bulma components for buttons, cards, etc..  
Sample notes are loaded from a JSON file, and nothing is saved on exit.
A demo is available on [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/notes-masonry-cpikr).
